**FlowSE** is the first flow-matching model for Speech Enhancement (SE), designed to address the key challenges faced by existing generative models in SE tasks. Traditional approaches like language model-based SE often degrade timbre and intelligibility due to **quantization loss**, while diffusion models suffer from **complex training** and **high inference latency**. FlowSE provides an efficient and innovative solution to these issues.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Flow Matching for Speech Enhancement**: FlowSE is trained on noisy mel spectrograms and optional text sequences, optimizing a condition flow matching loss with ground-truth mel spectrograms as labels.
- **Implicit Learning of Temporal-Spectral Structure and Text Alignment**: FlowSE learns the speech’s temporal-spectral structure and text-to-speech alignment implicitly without explicit alignment procedures.
- **Flexible Inference Modes**:
  - Inference with noisy mel spectrograms only
  - Inference with noisy mel spectrograms and additional transcripts, providing enhanced performance

## 📊 Experimental Results
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowSE significantly **outperforms state-of-the-art generative SE methods**, establishing a new standard for generative-based SE and highlighting the potential of flow matching in advancing the field.
